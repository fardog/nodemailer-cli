## Environment Variables

Some environment variables can be used in place of CLI options. CLI options override these environment variables, if used, so these can be thought of as defaults.

- **SMTP_SERVER** The hostname of the SMTP server to be used.
- **SMTP_PORT** The port on the SMTP server that should be connected to.
- **SMTP_USERNAME** The username to use when authenticating.
- **SMTP_PASSWORD** The password to use when authenticating.
- **SMTP_USE_SSL** Set this to a truth-y value to use SSL.
- **SMTP_USE_TLS** Set this to a truth-y value to use TLS (STARTTLS)
- **SMTP_SERVICE_NAME** This is one of nodemailer's service identifiers, if you want it to configure itself automatically.
